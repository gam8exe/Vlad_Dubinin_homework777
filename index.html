<h1>Robinson Crusoe<h1>
Chapter 1<br>


From early childhood, Robinson loved the sea more than anything else in the world, dreamed of long voyages. The boy's parents
this was very disliked, as they wanted a more peaceful and happy life for their son. My father wanted
to make him an important official.
However, the desire for adventure was stronger, so September 1, 1651
Robinson, who at that time was eighteen years old, without asking permission from his parents, along with
a friend boarded a ship from Hull to London.

Chapter 2<br>


On the first day the ship was caught in
severe storm. Robinson was sick and scared from the strong pitching. He swore a thousand times that if all
if he doesn't, he'll go back to his father and never swim in the sea again. However, the coming calm
and a glass of punch helped Robinson quickly forget about all the "good intentions".
The sailors were sure of
the safety of their ship, so they spent all their days in entertainment. On the ninth day of the voyage in the morning
a terrible storm broke out, and the ship leaked. A passing ship tossed them a Dinghy, and by evening
they managed to escape. Robinson was ashamed to return home, so he decided to go back to
swimming.
Chapter 3<br>


In London, Robinson became acquainted with the venerable old captain. A new acquaintance suggested Crusoe
go with him to Guinea. During the journey, the captain taught Robinson how to ship,
which was very useful to the hero in the future. In Guinea, Crusoe managed to profitably exchange the imported
trinkets on the Golden sand.
After the captain's death, Robinson went back to Africa. On this
once the trip was less successful: on the way their ship was attacked by Turkish pirates from Saleh.
Robinson was captured by the captain of a robber ship, where he stayed for almost three years. Finally to him
there was a chance to escape – the robber sent cruso, the boy Xuri and the moor to fish in the sea.
Robinson took with him everything necessary for a long voyage, and on the way threw the moor into the sea.

Robinson was on his way to Cape Verde, hoping to meet a European ship.

engaged in the cultivation of sugar cane and sugar production. Once familiar merchants suggested
Robinson will travel to Guinea again.
"In an evil hour" – on September 1, 1659, he set foot on
the ship's deck. "It was the same day that eight
years ago, I ran away from my father's house and so madly ruined my youth."
On the twelfth day
a heavy squall hit the ship. The storm lasted for twelve days, and their ship sailed wherever it was going.
driven by waves. When the ship ran aground, the sailors had to transfer to a boat. However, through
four miles away, the furious rampart capsized their ship.
Robinson was washed up on the beach. He,
the only one of the crew left alive. The hero spent the night in a high tree

Morning Robinson
I saw that their ship was washed up closer to the shore. Using spare masts, topmasts and yards, the hero made
the raft that brought planks, chests, food supplies, and a box of carpenter's tools to the shore,
weapons, gunpowder, and other necessities.
Returning to land, Robinson realized that he was on a desert island.
the island. He built himself a tent out of sails and poles, surrounding it with empty boxes and chests for protection
from wild animals. Every day, Robinson sailed to the ship, taking things that he might need.
Crusoe first wanted to throw away the money he found, but then, after thinking about it, left it. After Robinson visited
ship for the twelfth time, a storm swept the ship out to sea.
Soon Crusoe found a convenient place to live-on
a small smooth clearing on the slope of a high hill. Here the hero set up a tent, surrounding it with a fence of
high stakes, which could only be overcome with the help of a ladder.



Chapter 7<br>


Behind the tent, Robinson dug up

can destroy all his gunpowder, and then put it in different bags and stored separately. Robinson discovers
that there are goats on the island and started hunting them.

the hero from the ship transported two cats and a dog that lived with him.
Among other things, Robinson found ink
and paper and took notes for a while. "Sometimes I was attacked by despair, I experienced a deadly melancholy,
to overcome these bitter feelings, I took a pen and tried to prove to myself that in my plight
there are still a lot of good things."
Over time, Crusoe dug a back door in the hill and made furniture for himself.

From September 30
In 1659, Robinson kept a diary describing everything that happened to him on the island after the shipwreck.

With the beginning of the rains, Crusoe became ill and had a severe fever. He was cured with tobacco tincture with rum.

Exploring the island, the hero finds sugar cane, melons, wild lemons, grapes. The latter he dried in the sun to
prepare raisins for the future. In the blooming green valley, Robinson arranges a second home for himself – a "cottage in the forest".
Soon one of the cats brought three kittens.
Robinson learned to accurately divide the seasons into rainy and dry.
During rainy periods, he tried to stay at home.

baskets that he missed very much. Crusoe decided to explore the entire island and found a strip on the horizon

cedar wood. He managed to make an excellent boat, but, like the Dinghy, he could not launch it.

Crusoe's fourth year on the island ended. He ran out of ink and his clothes were worn out. Robinson sewed
I made three jackets out of sailors ' coats, a hat, jacket, and trousers out of the skins of dead animals, and an umbrella to protect me from the sun and rain.

Robinson built a small boat to circumnavigate the island by sea. Skirting the underwater rocks, Crusoe sailed far away from

only people were missing."

he saw that the footprint was much larger than his foot.
In fear, Crusoe wanted to disband all the cattle and dig up both fields, but
then I calmed down and changed my mind. Robinson realized that savages come to the island only occasionally, so it is important for him to just not get caught

On a day in December,
as he left the house at dawn, Robinson noticed a bonfire on the beach – the savages were having a bloody feast. Watching the cannibals from

Six Indian canoes landed on the island. The savages brought two prisoners with them. While they were doing the first one,
the second one ran away. The fugitive was chased by three men, two were shot by Robinson with a rifle, and the third was killed by the fleeing man himself with a saber.
Crusoe beckoned the startled fugitive to his side.
Robinson took the savage to the grotto and fed him. "He was a good-looking young man,
he was tall, well-built, and his arms and legs were muscular, strong, and at the same time extremely graceful; he looked to be in his twenties

Robinson took Friday with him on hunting trips as an assistant, taught the savage to eat animal meat. Friday started helping
Crusoe on the farm. When the savage learned the basics of English, he told Robinson about his tribe. Indians, from

Crusoe asked his companion about the surrounding land and its inhabitants
- people who live on neighboring Islands. As it turned out, the neighboring land is the island of Trinidad, where the wild tribes of the Caribbean live.

The English rowed ashore in a boat, and Crusoe counted eleven men, three of whom were prisoners.

the tide ran aground, so the sailors went for a walk on the island. At this time, Robinson was preparing his guns. At night, when the sailors fell asleep,
Crusoe came over to their captives. One of them, the captain of the ship, said that his crew mutinied and went over to the side of the "gang of scoundrels".
He and two of his companions barely persuaded the robbers not to kill them, but to land them on a deserted beach. Crusoe and Friday helped kill the ringleaders of the riot,

"As I found out later on shipboard
to the magazine, my departure took place on December 19, 1686. So I lived on the island for twenty-eight years, two months, and nineteen days."

Soon Robinson returned to his homeland. By that time, his parents had died, and he was met at home by his sisters and children and other relatives. All with more
they listened with enthusiasm to the incredible story of Robinson, which he told from morning to evening.
